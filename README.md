# mudclient69-deob
A nice client to demo Yoptin in. Minimally edited.

## Usage:
`java -jar ./mudclient69-deob.jar [ip address] [port]`

* `[ip address]`
  * an IPv4 address where the RSC69 compatible server is hosted
* `[port]`
  * network port number (e.g. 43594)

## Changes from vanilla:
1. A few fields are named, particularly surrounding this client's unique feature: Yoptin integration.
2. The two command line arguments are not authentic to this version, though IP and Port would later become authentic command line arguments.
3. Minimal editing to allow loading from local jag files.

No other logic changes have been made.
